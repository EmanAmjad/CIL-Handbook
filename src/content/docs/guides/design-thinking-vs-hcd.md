## How Does Design Thinking Fit In?
Design thinking is the creative process you follow when using human-centered design. It’s like the “recipe” for a great design. It implies that you should iterate creative techniques, such as brainstorming, prototyping, testing, and others, and strive to find non-obvious effective solutions. Design thinking is a process for creative problem-solving. It is a cornerstone for giving rise to innovative products and services. It allows us to resolve complex and tricky challenges and bring production quality and customer needs satisfaction to the very next level.

## Design thinking vs HCD - mind the difference
“Design thinking” and “human-centered design” are often referred to as synonyms, and for a reason. Both approaches represent a creative way of solving problems or implementing opportunities. Definitions of the two terms overlap significantly, but not wholly. 

The difference between design thinking and human-centered design lies in headlining priorities:
- The core idea of the design thinking process is to come up with a non-obvious effective solution
- The core idea of human-centered design is to bring the highest possible value to users.

A company can use design thinking principles to create something innovative. And combined with a human-centered design approach, it can assure that the innovation is beneficial for users. The two approaches work in synergy and allow a company to satisfy customer needs better and, hence, stay competitive in the long term.

## Combining design thinking with human-centered design
You can easily combine two approaches into a multi-purpose and straightforward “loop”:
- Start with in-depth learning of users' unsatisfied needs, motives, and behavioral patterns.
- List as many possible solutions to the identified “gaps” as you can, no matter how strange or obvious they seem
- Shortlist ideas or possible solutions by diverging and converging them
- Ideate different use cases
- Create prototypes and test them on real users
- Adjust the idea or solution according to users’ feedback.

        Combine two approaches to implement more effective solutions

No matter what exactly you do - develop a new application or try to boost your business growth - you can alter design thinking with a human-centered design approach and get a double or triple effect on efforts spent.

#### Wrapping up
Human-centered design and design thinking aren’t conflicting notions, so there’s nothing wrong with using them as synonyms colloquially. Still, you should remember the two terms slightly differ in underlining the key outcome of the creative thinking process. While design thinking emphasizes the importance of an unconventional course to create something innovative, the human-centered design puts the user’s comfort at the core. And when two approaches are combined, they become a creative thinking combo.

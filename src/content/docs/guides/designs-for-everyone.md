title: Designs That Work for Everyone
description: How to make Designs That Work for Everyone?
---
Human-centered design means thinking of everyone. For example:
- A book with large letters helps kids and people who don’t see well.
- A bus app that works offline helps where the internet isn’t great.

Inclusive design aims to remove the barriers that create undue effort and separation. It enables everyone to participate equally, confidently and independently in everyday activities. An inclusive approach to design offers new insights into the way we interact with the built environment. It creates new opportunities to deploy creative and problem solving skills. The British Standards Institute defines inclusive design as:

“The design of mainstream products and/or services that are accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible ... without the need for special adaptation or specialised design. ”

In summary, every design decision has the potential to include or exclude customers. Inclusive design is about making informed design decisions, by better understanding user diversity, which helps to include as many people as possible. User diversity covers variation in capabilities, needs and aspirations.

## What Is Inclusive Design?
Inclusive design describes methodologies to create products that understand and enable people of all backgrounds and abilities. Inclusive design may address accessibility, age, culture, economic situation, education, gender, geographic location, language, and race. The focus is on fulfilling as many user needs as possible, not just as many users as possible. At its core, inclusive design is about empathizing with users and adapting interfaces to address the various needs of those users. Inclusive design generates inclusive-design patterns. 
Let’s consider an example of an inclusive-design pattern.

Across the web, from government sites to job applications to obtrusive account-creation processes, users are asked to select their race from a predetermined set of options. When I was younger and trying to make a decision regarding this input, I struggled because the options were mutually exclusive. As a mixed-race woman, a form asking me to pick a single race felt like a small identity crisis — no one option did communicate my identity. Luckily, this form and its corresponding options have evolved to include a Two or more races option (or checkboxes instead of the former radio buttons). This is an example of an inclusive design pattern.

## Accessibility and Universal Design vs. Inclusive Design
Two concepts related to inclusive design that are often mixed up with it are accessibility and universal design. All three concepts aim to reduce barriers between humans and technology and create inclusive experiences. Accessibility is focused on ensuring that interfaces and technology can be used by people with disabilities (including auditory, cognitive, physical, and visual disabilities). Accessibility has a narrower scope than inclusive design in that it is focused on specific accommodations. Additionally, accessibility standards such as [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) make accessibility somewhat easier to assess than inclusive and universal design. However, [accessibility is only a bare minimum](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accessibility-is-not-enough/) for meaningful experiences for individuals with disabilities.

Universal design aims to create one experience that can be accessed and used to the greatest extent possible by all people. Unlike inclusive design, universal design enforces a single design solution without need for adaptations or specialized design. Inclusive design accepts and embraces multiple design variations so long as they achieve the desired outcome. In general, universal design is more widely used in tangible and environmental contexts (after all, it’s costly to produce multiple functional variations of a physical object or space). Comparatively, inclusive design is applied more frequently to digital-product design because it is relatively cheap and easy to adapt such interfaces.

While both inclusive design and accessibility aim to make products usable by people with disabilities, inclusive design takes a broader approach by considering the full range of human diversity. Accessibility typically focuses on technical standards to accommodate users with specific disabilities, whereas inclusive design seeks to create multiple ways for all users to participate.

## Inclusive design principles
Implementing inclusive design starts with a commitment to understanding and valuing human diversity. Businesses can begin by conducting user research to identify the needs of diverse users, including those with disabilities. Following best practices and guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), is crucial. 

If to translate accessibility guidelines into the design language, they would be saying the following:
- Use distinct colors and good contrast
- Write in simple language and use bullet points
- Create the logical, easy-to-follow layout
- Break content with images and videos
- Design large buttons and make them distinctive
- Use readable font size and ensure text magnification
- Describe links comprehensively
- Enable keyboard navigation
- Provide subtitles for video and transcripts for audio
- Add descriptive alt tags to images

This list doesn’t pretend to be extensive, including all the requirements of inclusive graphic design. I outlined those that would be great to focus on when working on your [website accessibility](https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/accessibility-in-ux-helpful-for-people-beneficial-for-business) improvement.

## Inclusive design examples
### Diverse Illustrations
For many years, designers opted for minimal illustrations that often consisted of outlines of characters with colorful hair. These characters were intended to be generic, and the absence of skin tone was meant to make the graphics inclusive. In reality, these designs did the opposite. Without skin tones or other characteristics to communicate diversity, these illustrations all looked like white people, thus excluding everyone else. Over the years, multiple companies have shifted their illustrations and imagery to be more diverse and align with their user populations.

### A Variety of Demographic Identifiers
In contexts where demographic identifiers (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation) are requested, provide inclusive options. For example, Tinder, a dating application, allowed users to type a word that described their gender identity and provided more than 30 options. This level of specificity was inclusive to users who align with the selections.

Tinder, a mobile-dating app, allowed users to select from a variety of gender identities. The interface also enabled users to share their gender on their profile, even though this setting was off by default.

### Inclusive Facets
When you understand the needs of your users, you can come up with some [delightful ways](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/theory-user-delight/) to satisfy those needs. For example, Pinterest, an image-sharing app, released a new feature which allowed users to [filter](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/filters-vs-facets/) based on some nontraditional options  — for example, by hair pattern  (e.g., protective, curly, straight). Though this pattern may seem like a minor addition, it is empathetic to Pinterest’s diverse user base and creates an inclusive browsing experience.

Pinterest added inclusive filters to enable users to sort hairstyles based on their hair pattern.

Similarly, Sephora allowed users to search skincare products by Age Range (e.g., Teens, 20s, 30s). This design pattern is inclusive because it enables users to find products that target age-specific concerns like acne or wrinkles.

Sephora provided a filter that allowed users to find products relevant to their age range.

Inclusive design can look different to different people. What may not seem exclusive or insensitive to you, can be incredibly offensive to another person. Remember, [you are not your user](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/false-consensus/). Use the examples as inspiration and consider the following tips to grow your inclusive-design practice:
- Prioritize inclusive research practices. When testing and evaluating your interfaces, ensure a diverse representation of users. Learn from this diversity and use it to target real needs.
- Educate stakeholders on how different people use technology. Involve them in your research, share examples, and highlight user quotes.
- Recognize exclusion. Don’t be biased into thinking your product is made for everyone. Monotony in aspects such as illustrations can communicate exclusion. Aim to reflect how people really are, not an oversimplified version.

## What Makes Good Design?
It’s not just about being useful. A good design should be:
- Easy to Understand: You don’t need a guide to figure it out.
- Enjoyable: It makes life easier or more fun.
- Built for the Long Run: It lasts and grows with people’s needs

### 1. Easy to Understand: No Manual Required
A good design feels intuitive. People can pick it up, use it, or navigate it without needing to read a detailed guide. The easier something is to use, the more people will want to use it. If a tool or system feels confusing, people might give up on it—even if it solves their problem.

How to Achieve This:
- Use clear, simple labels or instructions.
- Organize information logically. 
#### For example: 
- put the most frequently used options up front.
- Test with real users—if they struggle to figure it out, go back and simplify.
- Example: Think about smartphones. Even kids can figure out how to open apps because the design feels natural and straightforward.

### 2. Enjoyable: It Makes Life Easier or More Fun
A design isn’t just about getting the job done—it’s also about how it makes people feel. Enjoyable designs take the stress out of tasks or add delight to daily routines. When people enjoy using a tool, they’re more likely to keep using it. A frustrating design, on the other hand, can make users abandon it altogether.

How to Achieve This:
- Add small, thoughtful touches that surprise or please users (like fun animations or soothing colors).
- Make it fast and efficient. Nobody enjoys waiting!
- Reduce the number of steps required to complete an action.

#### Example: 
- A well-designed weather app shows the forecast with cheerful visuals and clear, simple navigation, making checking the weather a pleasant experience.

### 3. Built for the Long Run: Lasts and Grows with Needs
Good design adapts as the world changes and as users’ needs evolve. It doesn’t become obsolete quickly. People don’t want to keep switching tools. A design that grows with them builds trust and loyalty.

How to Achieve This:
- Use scalable technology that can handle more users or new features over time.
- Make updates easy to roll out, whether it’s a software patch or a hardware upgrade.
- Stay connected to user feedback even after launch to understand changing needs.

#### Example: 
- Online learning platforms that regularly add new features—like live classes, quizzes, and certifications—remain useful as education evolves.

Good design is about more than solving a problem—it’s about creating tools and systems that people genuinely enjoy using and that continue to meet their needs over time. Remember: simplicity, joy, and adaptability are the foundations of a successful human-centered design.

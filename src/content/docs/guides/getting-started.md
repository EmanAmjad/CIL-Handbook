## Introduction
A Code for Pakistan Civic Innovation Lab is a group of community volunteers who meet regularly to collaborate with local government, nonprofits and media organizations on technology, data, policy and design projects that strengthen their communities.

A Civic Innovation Lab (CIL) is not a physical entity but rather a community of passionate individuals committed to leveraging technology for social good. It consists of volunteers who come together—either in person or virtually—to collaborate on projects that enhance civic services, improve governance, and empower communities. Recognition as a CIL depends on active participation, consistent efforts in volunteering, and a shared commitment to making a difference. By working on impactful projects, engaging with stakeholders, and fostering collaboration, you can establish your Lab as a key player in the civic tech ecosystem and contribute to positive societal change.

Every lab is led by a Lead who is responsible for building the community and maintaining the relationship between the Lab and the local partners. Lab members meet at least monthly; most CIL meet with greater frequency and have a range of monthly programming.

All Labs are connected through an online forum in order to share stories and support each other’s work. Labs are also closely coordinated with Code for Pakistan’s other programs.
Who can participate in a Civic Innovation Lab?
Anyone who wants to build 21st century interfaces to the government and is interested to work on Open Data. Though most of our projects are technical, there are many roles that do not require programming skills including: design, community organizing, event planning, marketing, data wrangling, policy, and writing.

## What do Civic Innovation Labs do?
CIL meets regularly to collaborate with local stakeholders (including government, partner non-profit organizations and media organizations) on projects that focus on how to use modern web and data tools to improve civic interfaces.

Some Labs go beyond software and advocate for a change in city policy. These Labs work to build trust with their local governments and negotiate a shared vision. Some Labs have members who are on local civic tech advisory boards and are seen as influential members with respected public policy understanding.

## Who are the Labs for?
You can participate in our CILs network if you are a:
Technologist:  You are good at technology, data, policy, social media or design. Join the civic tech revolution and help us rewire our civic issues!
Government expert: Share your input as subject specialist with our tech team to design new innovations for local Government. We need you!
Citizen: As community members, we need to know how you want to experience civil services. Participate and help us understand citizens' needs and solve civic issues.
What if there isn’t a CIL where I live?
You can organize one! or If you think that is too much of a commitment, sign up to be notified when a CIL is started in your community. We’ll also keep you updated on ways you can participate individually in these activities.

## How to get recognised as a CIL?
To get recognized as an official Civic Innovation Lab (CIL), you need to demonstrate a strong commitment to civic tech and community impact. The key requirement is active participation in volunteer-driven projects that leverage technology, data, and policy to address local challenges. A recognized CIL is one that consistently engages with local stakeholders, organizes meetups, collaborates with government and nonprofits, and develops civic solutions. The more visible and impactful your work is, the more likely you are to gain recognition. Regular contributions, meaningful collaborations, and a strong volunteer network will help establish your Lab as a vital part of the Code for Pakistan ecosystem, driving positive change in society.

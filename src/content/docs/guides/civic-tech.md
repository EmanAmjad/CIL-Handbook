## Understanding Civic Tech
We have all experienced the long lines whilst waiting to apply for a driver’s licence, maybe you have no idea where to even begin when reporting a burst pipe in your neighbourhood, or perhaps you would love to get involved in the decision of how an empty plot of government land near your home is going to be utilised. What if I told you that there is a sector that exists to make these processes simpler and easier to navigate, helping you on your quest to become an engaged and informed citizen.

Think of civic tech as cool tools (like websites and apps) made to help people solve problems in their community. For example, it could help report a broken streetlight or find a park nearby. There is no universally accepted definition for civic tech, this is because it includes such a broad range of services and products. Simply put, it is the use of technology to better public services. Civic tech enhances the relationship between the government and its people by using software for communication, service delivery, decision making and political process. Civic tech, in short, is technology that positively impacts society — but that’s not the whole story. It is about creating tools that help make more democratic, transparent and people-centered public services, but it isn’t only about the tools themselves — it’s about the process through which these tools are created. One important element of the process, for example, is that the people who will be using the tool must be involved in its creation. Another thing that’s important to note is that you don’t need to be a technologist or know anything about technology to become involved.
Civic Tech involves leveraging technology to address civic issues, improve public services, and empower citizens. By adopting Human-Centered Design (HCD), Civic Innovation Labs aim to ensure these solutions are not just functional but genuinely impactful, catering to real user needs. The surge in popularity of social media has contributed to the proliferation of this trend by providing a shared platform for individuals to interact, opening up doors to a new variant of democracy termed as 'Digital Democracy'.

## The Core of Digital Democracy
The rise of civic technology in this new millennium has been organic and profound. It has not been led by politicians or corporations, nor by powerful knowledge-rich institutions or NGO's, but by individuals and loosely constituted groups with specific digital expertise and an interest in getting things done. Such individuals are not normally considered to be on the cutting edge of political and practical behaviour change. Across the world, small pockets of coders and developers have independently, and occasionally with a little peer support, created a range of online platforms to help citizens like themselves get government work for them in one small way or another.

Digital Democracy's primary goal is to provide channels for individuals to engage democratically using digital routes. It leverages advancements in technology to drive civic participation, boost governmental transparency, and elevate the standard of state services. In this climate, the relevance of Civic Tech is highlighted as it curates and provides digital tools that allow constituents to engage with their government on a more personal level - from reporting local infrastructural issues to participating in online public forums. Hence, Civic Tech is reshaping the way people interact with their government.

## The Intersection of Digital Democracy and Civic Tech

Civic Tech performs the vital function of bridging the gap between citizens and government. This expansive field entails:

- Online Government Services: Web-enabled interfaces that provide an array of government services such as renewals, tax payments, and other official document applications.
- Open Data Platforms: Cloud-based centers that offer public government information, driving transparency and enabling citizens to remain informed about government activities.
- Public Issue Report Platforms: Digital applications designed to allow residents to bring attention to public issues such as faulty street lighting or unlawful waste disposal.
- Digital Voting Platforms: Internet-based avenues that allow citizens to cast their votes seamlessly and conveniently.
- Citizen Input Platforms: Web forums which allow citizens to contribute their viewpoints on a spectrum of public concerns.

By offering these instruments, Civic Tech translates the possibility of digital democracy into achievable reality, allowing citizens to contribute constructively and significantly to the democratic process, breathing new life into the democratic framework.

Public issue reporting platforms empower citizens to make a positive difference in their respective locales. Such applications not only advance communal space but also create a robust sense of civic responsibility.
Crucially, Civic Tech refreshes democracy by empowering citizens to take an active role, ensuring their participation in the democratic journey. This signifies the evolution of digital democracy and the momentous contribution of Civic Tech. In light of these factors, it’s clear that Civic Tech is unlocking the immense potential of digital democracy. 


## Inciting Revolutionary Transformations in Civic Involvement

The real power of Civic Tech lies in utilizing cutting-edge technologies to enhance civic involvement. It hands an electronic platform to ordinary people, enabling them to voice their opinions, engage in relevant discussions, and imprint societal results, a marked shift from old participation methods reliant on physical attendance or outdated paperwork.

Civic Tech offers a wealth of benefits to boost the roles of citizens:

- Universal Accessibility: With the internet's worldwide presence, Civic Tech systems bridge geographical restrictions, hence significantly enlarging civic involvement.
- Boosted Transparency: Civic Tech brings administrative actions and verdicts to public visibility, cultivating a culture of responsibility and trustworthiness.
- Improved Efficiency: Civic Tech streamlines processes, thus enhancing productivity and effectiveness in civic involvement.
- Engaged Involvement: By creating a hub for collaboration and exchange, Civic Tech fuels active civic engagement, nurturing societal unity.

## Importance of Civic Tech:
The problems that have historically doomed the relationship between citizens and governments appear to be as prevalent today as they have ever been: corruption, mismanagement, inefficiency, and a lack of responsiveness. Around the world, trust between citizens and governments is at an all-time low and continues to erode precipitously. It isn’t surprising that citizens are feeling disenchanted with government — governments at all levels and in every region often fail to understand the needs of citizens. And even when they do, they may lack the resourcing and technical skills necessary to comprehensively address those needs. Similarly, citizens generally don’t believe that governments have their best interest at heart, and even if they did, citizens don’t trust that governments have the ability to effectively address the problems that they face everyday. 

Yet, while these issues between citizens and governments may seem intractable, the tools and solutions we now have available to tackle them are more sophisticated, numerous, and far-reaching than ever before.In this context, civic technology is playing an increasingly essential and impactful role. Civic technology provides an opportunity for citizens to connect with one another, to mobilize around common causes and concerns, to express their needs and desires to their government, and to more easily access the goods and services that the government provides. Similarly, for governments, civic technology provides an opportunity to become smarter and more efficient, to engage citizens, and to respond appropriately to their needs and concerns. It also provides governments an opportunity to create more inclusive and effective policies, and to better deliver for their citizens.

The connectivity of the internet has the potential to democratise a whole spectrum of previously complex or oblique processes through increased access, functionality and relative anonymity. Individuals that would never dream of asking a politician a direct question in a local meeting are able to ask directly from their armchairs without fear of public judgement or ridicule. Citizens that want information about government housing policies but don't have the mobility to visit a council office or library, can request electronic copies to their homes. And people just trying to go about their daily business that are inconvenienced by issues with their local area are able to report it efficiently and effectively without getting tied up in the kind of bureaucracy that has historically characterised public services.

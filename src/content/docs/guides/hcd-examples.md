## Real Life examples of Human-Centered Design

### Light for Learning

In regions without reliable electricity, students often struggle to study after dark. To address this, organizations have developed solar-powered lamps, providing a sustainable and affordable light source for education. For instance, the [Design Kit by IDEO](https://www.designkit.org/index.html) showcases various case studies where human-centered design has been applied to create impactful solutions. 

### Kid-Friendly Medicine
Administering medicine to children can be challenging due to unpleasant tastes. Pharmaceutical companies have employed human-centered design to develop flavored syrups, making the experience more palatable for kids. While specific case studies on this are limited, the general approach aligns with empathic design principles.

### Wheelchair Accessibility in Parks
Public spaces often lack facilities for individuals with disabilities. By applying human-centered design, parks have been redesigned to include wheelchair-accessible paths and equipment, promoting inclusivity. The Victorian Government shares successful [case studies](https://www.vic.gov.au/) on implementing human-centered design in public spaces.

### Clean Drinking Water Solutions
Access to clean water is a significant issue in many areas. Portable water filters have been designed to purify contaminated water, providing safe drinking options. The [Design Kit](https://www.designkit.org/case-studies/4.html) includes case studies on such innovations.

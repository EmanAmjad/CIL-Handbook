title: Phases of Human-Centered Design
description: What are the phases of Human-Centered Design?

According to design firm IDEO, these are the six phases of the HCD process.
## Phase 1: Observation
From the first phase we foster deep empathy with people. In this phase, our goal is to understand the people we’re designing for by observing and learning about them. We’ll put our assumptions aside and look at pain points and patterns of behaviour to understand how people feel about a given product.
Here's also the uncomfortable (but worthwhile!) nature of the “discovery” phase: because you’re letting user insights lead your design, you’re starting out with very little clarity on what insights you’ll uncover and what path forward will be best. (You’re “diverging.”) This part of the HCD process is called the “fuzzy front end.” 

The famous design squiggle, depicted below, is a visual demonstration of this early sense of mystery and messy-ness:

## Phase 2: Ideation
Here you and your team will come up with ideas based on what you learned in the previous phase. You’ll want to come up with as many ideas as you can. Even bad ideas can make it to the table as they can always have the root of a good idea in it. Eventually your team’s ideas will evolve in the right direction.

## Phase 3: Rapid prototyping
In this phase, you’ll create a simple prototype that will give you something to test with your users. This shouldn’t be a high fidelity prototype but one that has just enough of the idea that people can understand and comment on it.

## Phase 4: User feedback
Get your prototype in the hands of the people you’re designing for in this phase. This is the most critical phase of the design process because, without feedback from people, you won’t know if your solution needs to be adjusted and in which directions.

## Phase 5: Iteration
In this phase, use the insights you’ve gained from users to fuel changes to your design. Iterate, test, and iterate some more until your solution is fine-tuned and ready to be used. 

## Phase 6: Implementation
Here, your design is ready to be put into action and used in the real world. While the design seems finished, though, keep in mind that design is never truly done. Keep learning, keep iterating, and keep testing whenever possible to continue to improve the design.

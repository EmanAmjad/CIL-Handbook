## Examples of Collaboration between Civic Tech Communities and Governments Around the World
Every day, people use digital services provided by governments. On a normal day, people may use online government systems to pay taxes or express their opinions on public policy; on a special occasion, such as the outbreak of Covid-19, it may be an app created by governments to book a vaccination appointment or get the latest instructions on pandemic prevention. Sometimes people appreciate the digitization of these government services, sometimes they do not.
For example, a tax filing system that only works with Internet Explorer or a specific browser is not going to make people happy. Moreover, in authoritarian countries, people may encounter something more serious than a poorly designed government system: a surveillance tool may be installed in a government app, and everyone in the country is required to install the app on their mobile phones. And, of course, no one is allowed to see the source code of the app.
As is often the case with the digitization of services, there is a general awareness of the dangers. And while vigilance is certainly good and appropriate, it is equally important not to ignore the opportunities that digitization offers. By involving citizens, governments can ensure that the design and operation of public digital services meet people's needs. People will be able to review these digital services to know whether they meet an ideal standard of quality, cybersecurity, privacy, accessibility, and transparency. Governments and the public can also inspire each other to innovate approaches to digital service delivery, thereby improving existing services.

## What Needs to Be Done to Facilitate Such Collaboration?
Experts have offered a number of important and practical policy recommendations on how to facilitate such collaboration between civic tech communities and governments. We have distilled their recommendations into the following five points:

- Governments should offer more support to civic tech, such as funding, improving regulations, institutional support, and flexible policy initiatives such as sandbox for encouraging innovation of civic tech.
- Governments should enhance digital literacy of public servants and increase its support to those public servants who actively reach out to civic tech communities.
- Governments should consistently adopt the concept and standard of open data to public data in various fields since open data is seen as an infrastructure to inspire more collaboration. The collaboration between civic tech communities, citizens, and governments should be based on openness, trust, participation, and equality.
- Governments should improve relevant laws and regulations by reducing unnecessary bureaucratic procedures and actively establishing a supportive and clear legal framework that encourages civic tech communities to innovate and collaborate with governments.
- Engagement is an activity that generates information and relationships. Governments need to effectively manage these relationships if democracy is to be participatory, and the information gathered from citizens through engagement needs to be considered or utilised if democracy is to be truly representative. This is the sweet sauce of genuinely open, transparent and accountable government.  There are so many tools available for online engagement and digital democracy so it can be challenging to make sense of the market and which tools to use in different situations. But this focus is distracting us from the real issue: how governments can use citizen ‘input’ (data they invite from citizens during engagement on policies, programs and services), and leverage the goodwill of those who want to participate in democracy and communities.

## Conclusion: Transforming Communities Through Civic Tech
Civic tech stands at the exciting crossroads of technology and civic engagement, driving innovation in how communities solve problems and governments deliver services. By empowering citizens with tools like apps and platforms, civic tech enables greater participation, transparency, and collaboration in addressing local issues. Through revolutionary ideas such as digital democracy and community-driven innovation, civic tech ensures that technology is not just a convenience but a powerful agent of change. From apps that let you report a pothole to platforms that help streamline government services, the possibilities are endless. Success stories from across the globe demonstrate how civic tech can bring about transformative results, improve public service delivery, and strengthen the bond between citizens and governments.

However, to maximize its potential, civic tech needs strong collaboration between governments, civic organizations, and communities. By fostering partnerships, sharing resources, and leveraging technology creatively, civic tech can play a pivotal role in creating smarter, more inclusive, and sustainable communities for all. The future of civic engagement is bright, and with civic tech, we're only just getting started!
